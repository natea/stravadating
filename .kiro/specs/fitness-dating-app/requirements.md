# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a dating application that integrates with Strava to verify users' fitness levels before allowing them to join the platform. The app will use Strava's activity data to determine if potential users meet minimum fitness thresholds, creating a community of active individuals seeking romantic connections based on shared fitness interests and lifestyle compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness-conscious individual, I want to join a dating platform that only admits active people, so that I can connect with potential partners who share my commitment to health and fitness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user attempts to register THEN the system SHALL require Strava account connection before account creation
2. WHEN a user connects their Strava account THEN the system SHALL retrieve their last 90 days of activity data
3. IF a user's fitness metrics meet the minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL allow account creation
4. IF a user's fitness metrics do not meet the minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL deny registration with clear explanation
5. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL create a user profile with basic Strava fitness statistics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure fitness thresholds for admission, so that I can maintain the quality and standards of the user base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses threshold settings THEN the system SHALL display configurable minimum requirements for weekly distance, weekly activities, and average pace
2. WHEN an administrator updates threshold values THEN the system SHALL validate the new thresholds are reasonable and save them
3. WHEN threshold changes are saved THEN the system SHALL apply new criteria to future registrations immediately
4. WHEN evaluating user fitness THEN the system SHALL use current threshold values for admission decisions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want my profile to showcase my fitness achievements from Strava, so that potential matches can see my activity level and fitness interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display recent Strava activities, total distance, and favorite activity types
2. WHEN a user's Strava data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh profile statistics within 24 hours
3. WHEN other users view a profile THEN the system SHALL show fitness compatibility scores based on activity preferences
4. IF a user's fitness level drops below threshold after registration THEN the system SHALL send warnings but maintain account access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and match with other users based on fitness compatibility, so that I can find partners with similar activity levels and interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses potential matches THEN the system SHALL display profiles with fitness compatibility indicators
2. WHEN calculating compatibility THEN the system SHALL consider activity types, frequency, and performance levels
3. WHEN users match THEN the system SHALL enable messaging with shared activity suggestions
4. WHEN a user searches for matches THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by activity type, distance range, and performance level

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Strava data to remain secure and private, so that I can trust the platform with my personal fitness information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Strava THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all Strava activity information
3. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL remove all stored Strava data within 30 days
4. WHEN accessing Strava data THEN the system SHALL only request minimum necessary permissions
5. IF Strava API access is revoked THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the Strava connection has been revoked, and we can no longer access their data.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work reliably with Strava's API limitations, so that my experience is smooth and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Strava API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry appropriately
2. WHEN Strava is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN processing large amounts of activity data THEN the system SHALL handle requests efficiently without timeouts
4. WHEN new users register during peak times THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
